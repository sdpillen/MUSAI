Version 1.1.3.10 (2015-11-10)
Mega Electronics Ltd (mega@megaemg.com, http://www.megaemg.com)
- New feature: Supported new event port "Software". The name of the software component that
  generated the event is read from eventDescriptions.bin, if it's available.
- New feature: Supported new event types MEP (from eMotion Biolink) and response writer events.
- New feature: Supported main unit index and microsecond-precision time stamp. This differs from the
  field markers.time, which is calculated on the basis of data indexes. The new field markers.timeStampMicro
  can thus be more precise than markers.time.
- Renamed event type and port "Unknown" to "N/A".
- Event type and port are now separate fields markers.type and markers.port.

Version 1.1.3.9 (2015-06-01)
Mega Electronics Ltd (mega@megaemg.com, http://www.megaemg.com)
- Bug fix: chunkSize was wrong when only subset of available inputs are read.

Version 1.1.3.8 (2014-12-05)
Mega Electronics Ltd (mega@megaemg.com, http://www.megaemg.com)
- Added an example script, which read multiple measurement phases in one for-loop.
- Improved logging.

Version 1.1.3.7 (2014-11-20)
Mega Electronics Ltd (mega@megaemg.com, http://www.megaemg.com)
- Optimized binary file reading and enabled single input reading.

- New feature: The reader is now able to read measurements with Protocol.xml revision up to 4.
- New feature: Version incompatibility now produces a warning instead of an error.
- Removed unnecessary demo_textprogressbar.m.

Version 1.1.3.4 (2012-06-18)
Mega Electronics Ltd (mega@megaemg.com, http://www.megaemg.com)
- New feature: The reader is now able to read measurements with events.bin revision up to 2.
- Minor editing of comments in the m-code.

Version 1.1.3.3 (2012-01-20)
Mega Electronics Ltd (mega@megaemg.com, http://www.megaemg.com)
- Minor editing of comments in the m-code.

Version 1.1.3.2 (2012-01-04)

- Bug fix: Removed a debugging code block from module_read_neurone_data.m, which interfered with normal function.
- Bug fix: Comment text is now read correctly.

Version 1.1.3.1 (2011-12-22)
Mega Electronics Ltd (mega@megaemg.com, http://www.megaemg.com)
- Bug fix: Event type did not support types Stimulation, Video, Mute and Out.

- New feature: Handling of file revisions.

Version 1.1.2.1 (2011-04-15)
Mega Electronics Ltd (mega@megaemg.com, http://www.megaemg.com)
- File structure identifier 'FIOH_BWRC' replaced by 'N/A' and edited the comment.
- Changed recording.device.version to point to version of NeurOne software, rather than revision of the XML file.
- Switched from deprecated Gain and Offset variables to use Range and RangeAsCalibrated.
- Added some strrep() and genvarname() lines to handle variable values with Matlab-illegal characters.
- Reordered optional input parameters to facilitate measurement phase selection.
